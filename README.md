# EXA-sim
Simulate EXAs in your own home!

This project is written in python and allows you to write level and EXA files and run them both.
For examples of this, see `nocodecs.py`, `level.json`, and `test.exa`.

Right now, the `M` register is still a work in progress, but I have a pretty good idea of how to finish it.
